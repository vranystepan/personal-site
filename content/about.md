Hi there, Iâ€™m Stepan and my mission is to help you with your journey to the Cloud.
My journey starts almost ten years ago back in 2010 when I started in my first job
as an Integration technician. It was a factory, I was configuring tons of servers
for the enterprise customers and I've learned there one important thing: automation
is the key, teach computers how they can work for you and then focus on the
improvement of the process. 

After some time, I moved to the engineering role and I become a technical leader
for the small group of talented technicians. After some time, I moved to the
engineering role and I become a technical leader for the small group of talented technicians.
Then, I was chosen by our customer to become a technology consultant in the local
team and this is how I got to Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

In total, I spent in this factory for almost eight years. And I really don't regret it.
This is a key part of my work attitude, **I'm problem solver and
I could not become this person without such experience.**

As I wanted to know all the stuff I was working with even from the administrator point of view,
I've decided to move to a different company to the System Administrator role.

It was really legacy environment, everyone was really stressed and on-call shifts were a nightmare. 
Furthermore, I felt an absolute disconnect from the customer and the development cycle so after a short
time period I've resigned and moved to the next job role with name "DevOps Engineer."
